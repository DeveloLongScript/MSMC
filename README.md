# MSMC
A bare bones login library for Minecraft based projects to authenticate individuals with a Microsoft account.

# Support
Atm you can get support via Discord (link below).
<p>
   <a href="https://discord.gg/3hM8H7nQMA">

      alt="chat on Discord"></a>
</p>
   
# Supported gui frameworks
If you're using MSMC with one of the frameworks below. The behaviour each framework displays should be identical. 
Mainly each will generate a pop-up that can be used by the end user to login. In-line logins, where the main window of your app is redirected to allow a user to log in should be implemented manually. Check the wiki page for more information! {Coming soon!}

## "Raw"
This is not a framework as this method takes advantage off the chromium based web browsers a user will likely already have on their machine. 
Windows already ships with one, Microsoft edge, and you're in full control of you launcherâ€™s dependencies on Linux.

Chromium based web browser that are compatible with this method:
Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Vivaldi, Blisk, Brave Browser, Yandex (Only Mac/Linux), Chromium (Linux only)
No additional dependencies needed! 
###### Raw doesn't respect the "resizable" window property
### Example 
Please note that the example is running under node and was tested running under node
   ```js
const msmc = require("msmc");
const fetch = require("node-fetch");
//msmc's testing enviroment sometimes runs into this issue that it can't load node fetch
msmc.setFetch(fetch)
msmc.fastLaunch("raw", 
   (update) => {
        //A hook for catching loading bar events and errors, standard with MSMC
        console.log("CallBack!!!!!")
        console.log(update)
    }).then(result => {
        //If the login works
        if (msmc.errorCheck(result)){
            console.log("We failed to log someone in because : "+result.reason)
            return;
        }
        console.log("Player profile and mojang token : "+result);
    }).catch(reason=>{
        //If the login fails
        console.log("We failed to log someone in because : "+reason);
    })
```
## NW.js
You should use the require method to load this module. Loading it by linking directly to the index.js file from the browser side of things may lead to unintended 
errors and glitches our testing did not account for. 
### Example 
If you noticed that this and the raw gui framework has the same example bar the change of the word "raw" to "nwjs". That's more due to the new architecture in 2.2.0 allowing us to streamline documentation. 
   ```js
const msmc = require("msmc");
const fetch = require("node-fetch");
//msmc's testing enviroment sometimes runs into this issue that it can't load node fetch
msmc.setFetch(fetch)
msmc.fastLaunch("nwjs", 
    (update) => {
        //A hook for catching loading bar events and errors, standard with MSMC
        console.log("CallBack!!!!!")
        console.log(update)
    }).then(result => {
        //If the login works
        if (msmc.errorCheck(result)){
            console.log("We failed to log someone in because : "+result.reason)
            return;
        }
        console.log("Player profile and mojang token : "+result);
    }).catch(reason=>{
        //If the login fails
        console.log("We failed to log someone in because : "+reason);
    })
```
## Electron
It is recommended to run the code for this library on the back-end side of electron. This is mainly due to security and the fast launch methods using functions and objects not available on the front end of electron. 

Do note that some frameworks that use electron as a base might not have these issues, but it is still something you should consider if you're having issues.
### Example 
This is a code sample for electron should be added to your main.js file.
```js
app.whenReady().then(() => {
  ...
    require("msmc").fastLaunch("electron", 
        (update) => {
            //A hook for catching loading bar events and errors, standard with MSMC
            console.log("CallBack!!!!!")
            console.log(update)
        }).then(result => {
            //If the login works
             if (msmc.errorCheck(result)){
                console.log("We failed to log someone in because : "+result.reason)
                return;
            }
            console.log("Player profile and mojang token : "+result);
        }).catch(reason=>{
            //If the login fails
            console.log("We failed to log someone in because : "+reason);
        })
 ...
})
```

# Examples

## MCLC example

A basic example of how to hook this library into <a href="https://github.com/Pierce01/MinecraftLauncher-core#readme">Mincraft Launcher core</a> to launch Minecraft

```js
const { Client, Authenticator } = require('minecraft-launcher-core');
const launcher = new Client();
const msmc = require("msmc");
const fetch = require("node-fetch");
//msmc's testing enviroment sometimes runs into this issue that it can't load node fetch
msmc.setFetch(fetch)
msmc.fastLaunch("raw",
    (update) => {
        //A hook for catching loading bar events and errors, standard with MSMC
        console.log("CallBack!!!!!")
        console.log(update)
    }).then(result => {
        //Let's check if we logged in?
        if (msmc.errorCheck(result)){
            console.log(result.reason)
            return;
        }
        //If the login works
        let opts = {
            clientPackage: null,
            // Pulled from the Minecraft Launcher core docs , this function is the star of the show
            authorization: msmc.getMCLC().getAuth(result),
            root: "./minecraft",
            version: {
                number: "1.17.1",
                type: "release"
            },
            memory: {
                max: "6G",
                min: "4G"
            }
        }
        console.log("Starting!")
        launcher.launch(opts);

        launcher.on('debug', (e) => console.log(e));
        launcher.on('data', (e) => console.log(e));
    }).catch(reason => {
        //If the login fails
        console.log("We failed to log someone in because : " + reason);
    })

```

## Pure Node Example:
This is the set-up you'd use if you where only using node or an incompatible gui framework. Like writing a terminal based minecraft launcher!
```js
const MSMC = require("msmc");
MSMC.login({ client_id: "<token>" }, 
    (link) => {
            //This is the link to the login page
        console.log("Click ME!!!!");
        console.log(link);
        },(update) => {
            //A hook for catching loading bar events and errors
            console.log("CallBack!!!!!");
            console.log(update);
        }
    ).then((result) => {
           //Let's check if we logged in?
        if (msmc.errorCheck(result)){
            //We had an error? Lets see what it was. 
            console.log("Failed!!!!!!!");
            console.log(result)
            return;
        }
        console.log("Logged in!!!!!!!");
        //Else, lets continue
        console.log(result)
    }).catch(reason=>{
        //If the login fails
        console.log("We failed to log someone in because : "+reason);
    })
```

# Docs: Types

## prompt

For more information. Check out Microsoft's support page: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-auth-code-flow#request-an-authorization-code

Basically this is the prompt value in the request sent to Microsoft. This should only be important if you're using either the fastLaunch or Launch functions under either Electron or NW.js

```ts
type prompt = "login" | "none" | "consent" | "select_account";
```

## mclcUser
 A copy of the user object mclc uses
```ts
type mclcUser = {
    access_token: string;
    client_token?: string;
    uuid?: string;
    name?: string;
    user_properties?: Partial<any>;
}
```
## framework
A list of gui frameworks supported by this library.
Used by the launch and fastLaunch functions to figure out what functions they should target.
```ts
type framework = "electron" | "nwjs" | "raw";
```
# Docs: Interfaces

## token

The Oauth2 details needed to log you in.

Resources

1. https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/auth-register-app-v2
2. https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/auth-v2-user#1-register-your-app
3. https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/RegisteredApps

Recommendations:

1. Use "Mobile and desktop applications" as your type setting and make sure to set it up to only use "Personal Microsoft accounts only".
   You're not a university!

2. set the redirect to "http://localhost/...", With localhost specifically Microsoft does not check port numbers.
   This means that http://localhost:1/... to http://localhost:65535/... are all the same redirect to MS. (http://localhost/... == http://localhost:80/... btw)
   This library does not allow you to set the port manually, due to the extreme risk of unforeseen bugs popping up.

3. If you set the redirect to, for example, "http://localhost/Rainbow/Puppy/Unicorns/hl3/confirmed" then the variable {redirect} needs to equal "Rainbow/Puppy/Unicorns/hl3/confirmed".

4. Basically the redirect field is equal to your redirect URL you gave Microsoft without the "http://localhost/" part.
   Please keep this in mind or you'll get weird errors as a mismatch here will still work...sort of.

```ts
interface token {
    client_id: string;
    clientSecret?: string;
    redirect?: string;
    prompt?: prompt;
}
```
## profile 
A version of a Minecraft profile you'd get from the auth end points
```ts
interface profile {
    id: string, name: string, skins?: [], capes?: []
}
```
## result
The return object that all the async login procedures return<br>

Possible values for the 'type' parameter in this interface:
<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Value</th>
        <th>Cause</th>
        <th>Other fields</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Success</td>
        <td>The user has been logged in and it has been verified that the user owns a licence to the game</td>
        <td>
            access_token&nbsp;:&nbsp;string<br>
            profile&nbsp;:&nbsp;profile
        </td> 
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>DemoUser</td>
        <td>The user has been logged in, but does not appear to own the game.
        <br>THIS IS ONLY MEANT TO BE USED FOR LAUNCHING THE GAME IN DEMO MODE</td>
        <td>
            access_token&nbsp;:&nbsp;string<br>
            reason&nbsp;:&nbsp;string
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Authentication</td>
        <td>The user could not be logged in</td>
        <td>
            reason&nbsp;:&nbsp;string<br>
            data&nbsp;:&nbsp;Response
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Cancelled</td>
        <td>The user closed the login prompt (Gui based login flows)</td>
        <td>
            No added fields. 
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Unknown</td>
        <td>This unused at the moment</td>
        <td>
            No added fields. 
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>

The resulting typescript object.<br> 

```ts
    interface result {
        type: "Success" | "DemoUser" | "Authentication" | "Cancelled" | "Unknown"
        /**Your classic Mojang auth token.*/
        "access_token"?: string, 
        /**Player profile. Similar to the one you'd normally get with the Mojang login*/
        profile?: profile,
        /**Used with the error types */
        reason?: string,
        /**Used when there was a fetch rejection.*/
        data?: Response,
    }
```
## update
Used in the callback that is fired multiple times during the login process to give the user feedback on how far along the login process is

```ts
interface update {
    type: "Loading" | "Error" | "Starting" ; //See table below!
    /**Some information about the call. Like the component that's loading or the cause of the error. */
    data?: string;
    /**Used by the rejection type.*/
    response?: Response;
    /**Used to show how far along the object is in terms of loading*/
    percent?: number;
}
```

Possible values for the 'type' parameter:
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Value</th>
            <th>Cause</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>"Loading" </td>
            <td>This gives input with regards to how far along the login process is.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>"Error"</td>
            <td>This is given with a normal MC account error and will give you some user readable feedback. </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>"Starting"</td>
            <td>This is fired once when the whole loading process is started. This is mainly for setting up loading bars and stuff like that. </td>
        </tr>
    </table>

## windowProperties

Window properties is set to any to avoid needing both nw.js and electron loaded as developer dependencies<br>
The common properties between both libraries has been backed into the type information for this interface however<br>
See <a href="https://www.electronjs.org/docs/api/browser-window#new-browserwindowoptions">this</a> resource for Electron, if you want to know what options are available <br>
See <a href="https://nwjs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/References/Manifest%20Format/#window-subfields">this</a> resource for NW.js, if you want to know the available options<br>

```ts
interface windowProperties {
    width: number;
    height: number;
    resizable?: boolean; 
    [key: string]: any;
}
```
# Docs: Functions

## setFetch
An override to manually define which version of fetch should be used <br>
fetchIn => A version of fetch 
```ts
function setFetch(fetchIn: any): void;
```
## createLink
This function will create a login link based on the inputs provided. <br>
Note that this function is called internally after the redirect has been formatted. Aka after "http://localhost:\<port\>/" is appended to the redirect. <br>
This is done to allow us to create the "fastLaunch" methods which don't rely on an internal http server<br>
token => Your MS Login token. Mainly your client ID, client secret (optional  | Depends how azure is set up) and a redirect;<br>
returns => A link you can plug into a web browser to send a user to a ms login page
```ts
function createLink(token: token): String;
```
## authenticate
Used when you want to implement your own login code, but still want msmc to handle authentication for you. <br>
code => The code gotten from a successful login <br>
MStoken => The Microsoft token object used to obtain the login code <br>
updates => A callback that one can hook into to get updates on the login process<br>
returns => A promise that will grant you a user profile and mojang login token<br>
```ts
function authenticate(code: string, MStoken: token, updates?: (info: update) => void): Promise<result>;
```
## refresh
Used to refresh login tokens. It is recommended to do this at start up after calling validate to check if the client token needs a refresh<br>
profile => Player profile. Similar to the one you'd normally get with the Mojang login<br>
updates => A callback that one can hook into to get updates on the login process<br>
MStoken => Microsoft token object used to obtain the login code  (Optional, will use the vanilla client token if it doesn't have anything)<br>
returns => A promise that will grant you an updated user profile and Mojang login token<br>
```ts
function refresh(profile: profile, updates?: (info: update) => void, MStoken?: token): Promise<result>;
```
## validate
Checks if a profile object is still valid<br>
profile => Player profile. Similar to the one you'd normally get with the Mojang login<br>
return => Returns a boolean stating whether a set account is still valid <br>
```ts
 function validate(profile: profile): Boolean;
```
## login
A generic login method. Useful if you aren't using electron or NW.js and want to make a terminal launcher or are using an unsupported framework<br>
token => Your MS Login token. Mainly your client ID, client secret (optional  | Depends how azure is set up) and a redirect (Do not include http://localhost:<port\>/ as that's added for you!)<br>
callback => The callback will give you a link you can redirect a user to. <br>
updates => A callback that one can hook into to get updates on the login process <br>
returns => A promise that will grant you a user profile and Mojang login token<br>
```ts
 function login(token: token, callback: (info: string) => void, updates?: (info: update) => void): Promise<result>;
```
## launch
Used with electron or nwjs to launch a popup that a user can use to sign in with<br>
type => The GUI framework this is compatible with <br>
token => Your MS Login token. Mainly your client ID, client secret<br>
updates => A callback that one can hook into to get updates on the login process<br>
properties => See windowProperties interface for more information<br>
returns => A promise that will grant you a user profile and mojang login token<br>
```ts
 function launch(type: framework, token: token, updates?: (info: update) => void, properties?: windowProperties): Promise<result>;
```
## fastLaunch
Mimics the vanilla launcher in how it works. Like launch in creates a pop-up a user can log in with
type => The GUI framework this is compatible with <br>
updates => A callback that one can hook into to get updates on the login process<br>
prompt => See the type definition for "prompt" for more information<br>
properties => See windowProperties interface for more information<br>
returns => A promise that will grant you a user profile and mojang login token<br>
```ts
function fastLaunch(type: framework, updates?: (info: update) => void, prompt?: prompt, properties?: windowProperties): Promise<result>;
```
## getMCLC

Replaces some of the functions the Authenticator component in MCLC.

### getAuth

This serves as a MSMC friendly version of getAuth function in MCLC's Authenticator component. Translating the information MSMC gets into something mclc can comprehend. This does however not work with normal Mojang accounts

### validate

This serves as a drop in replacement for the validate function in MCLC's Authenticator component. This works with Mojang and Microsoft accounts. 

### refresh

This serves as a drop in replacement for the refreshAuth function in MCLC's Authenticator component. This will refresh vanilla and MSMC accounts. A hidden \_msmc variable is used to determine how an account should be refreshed so please avoid removing that somehow since the Mojang method of refreshing accounts is not compatible with MSMC signed in accounts.

```ts
function getMCLC(): {
    getAuth: (info: result) => Promise<mclcUser>
    validate: (profile: mclcUser) => Promise<Boolean>
    refresh: (profile: mclcUser) => Promise<mclcUser>
};
```
## errorCheck
Checks if a returned bundle of information is valid and if the login procedure has been successful 

```ts
function errorCheck(result: result): Boolean;
```
## loadLegacy
For launchers built against version 2.1.x series of this gui. <br>
This is here to allow you to update without rewriting everything. New launchers should avoid using it! <br>
###### Will be removed by version 2.4.0
```ts
function loadLegacy(): void;
```
# Final notes
This module is ES6 compatible. [This mostly affects typescript users]
