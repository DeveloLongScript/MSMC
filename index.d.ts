 * 
 * 
 * Recommendations: 
 * 
 * 1) Use "Mobile and desktop applications" as your type setting and make sure to set it up to only use "Personal Microsoft accounts only". 
 * You're not a university!
 * 
 * 2) set the redirect to "http://localhost/...", With localhost specifically Microsoft does not check port numbers. 
 * This means that  http://localhost:1/... to http://localhost:65535/... are all the same redirect to MS. (http://localhost/... == http://localhost:80/... btw)
 * This app does not allow you to set the port manually, due to the extreme risk of unforseen bugs popping up. 
 * 
 * 3) If you set the ridirect to, for example, "http://localhost/Rainbow/Puppy/Unicorns/hl3/confirmed" then the variable {redirect} needs to equal "Rainbow/Puppy/Unicorns/hl3/confirmed".
 * 
 * 4) Basically the redirect field is equal to your redirect URL you gave microsoft without the "http://localhost/" part. 
 * Please keep this in mind or you'll get weird errors as a mismatch here will still work...sort of.
